# Course_Django

In order to start the project, after downloading from GitHub, go to the folder with the file manage.py and open the command line in it, where to register the following commands:
1) python manage.py makemigrations
2) python manage.py migrate
After successful execution of these commands, you need to start the Django server:
python manage.py runserver
Go to the link http://127.0.0.1:8000, here you can see the task I did, for easier work I added a minimum front end.
